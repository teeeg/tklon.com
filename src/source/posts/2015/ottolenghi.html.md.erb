> I don't write vegetarian cookbooks out of ideology I write what I am passionate about.

[NPR interviews Ottolenghi](http://www.npr.org/2014/10/19/356947700/chef-ottolenghi-makes-the-case-for-plenty-more-vegetables)

> The difficulty with vegetarianism, I find, is that it's very exclusive. It means like, I never look at fish or meat in my life. I grew up in Jerusalem in the Middle East and in various parts of the Middle East and Asia the diet is very plant based and doesn't include lots of meat in it. Meat is more special, you add a little bit of it or use don't use any at little but or not at. That attitude i think is a very healthy attitude. It's not about denying yourself of something completely it's about celebrating the wonderful world of vegetables.

 > The hummus that we have in Jerusalem is extremely popular around mid-day or late-morning where it is brunch, served warm in a big plate with all kinds of condiments: raw onion, lots of olive oil drizzled on top, some lemon juice, hard boiled egg. And it's a whole meal. It's a luscious wonderful whole meal that until you've had it you don't know what you're missing.

I really resonated with his perspective on the pleasure of collaborating with like minds. 

> We are food geeks. So we like to spend our time talking about food and analyzing it. There's something completely liberating with being with someone who is a bit like you in that department you know someone who doesn't think it's completely boring to discuss quantity of spices or this and that combination because it's great. There's a certain perfectionism that you don't always find in a keen spirit. We are like that. We are very similar in that respect.
