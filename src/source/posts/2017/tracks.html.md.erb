> The trip was easy. It was no more dangerous than crossing the street, or driving to the beach, or eating peanuts. The two important things that I did learn were that you are as powerful and strong as you allow yourself to be, and that the most difficult part of any endeavor is taking the first step, making the first decision.

[Tracks](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2167266/) is a meditative film -- lots of sweeping landscape portraits of the Australian outback. [The book](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00F0ZBUF4) is one of my favorites - pages wandering through outback and Robyn's ruminations on man and nature. 

The photographer Rick Smolan gives a great peak at Robyn's personality.
