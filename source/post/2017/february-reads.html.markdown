##### Phil Knight - _Shoe Dog_

Nike feels like one of the first lifestyle brands. They and Apple both went public the same week at the same price in 1980. They were not afraid of market differentiation: their advertising sought to inspire and be the spokesperson for runners anywhere, they packaged shoes in the iconic orange shoe box while everyone else used white or blue and always were and still are pushing shoe designs like the original Nike Air Max (there's a great netflix episode of ["Abstract"](https://www.netflix.com/title/80057883) with the originator of the [exposed sole design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nike_Air_Max) Tinker Hatfield).

I loved the origin story of Coach Bowerman stitching his own designs for his Oregon athletes. Nike was born out of track and field: a lot of early Nike employees (and the CEO today) were original track and field athletes. In some ways the Nike story reminds me of Yvon Chougard's self-labeling as a "reluctant businessman." 

The story focuses on early days of negotiating contracts, finding capital and the right people. I was expecting more insight into the culture and creative processes at Nike or at least more details about the sweat-factory scandal. Instead this book is paints a picture of a scrappy organization struggling to find the next buck, make ends meet for the next production run. Pretty stressful experience! 

##### Brit Bennett - _The Mothers_

A tale of friendship and adolescence based in southern California narrated from the perspective of a black community. For me, despite its premise, this book prompted a lot of interesting contemplation about identity and race. It feels like the book's relationship with race is designed to reveal the nature of being black in America today. `Whiteness` as a pervasive influence that seeps through the narrative despite race not being a pivotal element of the setting or plot.

> He liked to refer to his whiteness the way all white liberals did: only acknowledging it when he felt oppressed by it, otherwise pretending it didnâ€™t exist.

I really enjoyed [this article's](http://news.nationalpost.com/arts/books/book-reviews/brit-bennetts-haunting-the-mothers-portrays-female-friendship-and-a-love-triangle-that-moves-in-all-directions) interpretation: 

> The Mothers moves around those expectations, simply by setting the story in a world where whiteness is adjacent, but not invisible. Most of the characters are aware that they are, in fact, shadowed by whiteness. But the book denies that form, while acknowledging its veracity..

##### Kevin Kelly - _The Inevitable_

The chapter on cognification I think is one of those things that in hindsight will seem so obvious. 
The water is rising, but it's still turbulent, we can't see how far the water truly has risen. 

Lots of ruminations on society's co-evolution with technologies and how they progress in tandem, social evolutions
enable technical evolutions to become mainstream and vice versa. 

I love Kelly's technological optimism; especially of decentralization, crowd sourced intelligence, and his relentless pursuit of redefining our relationship with technology as our understanding shifts. Kelly believes that we're just getting started. 

One idea I was unaware of is the concept of [zillionics](http://kk.org/thetechnium/zillionics/) which is in short: 

> If there is enough of something, it is possible, indeed not unusual, for it to have properties not exhibited at all in small, isolated examples. 

It reminds me of dynamic systems in chaos theory where apparent randomness and unpredictability is deterministic. I wonder if the computational all-knowing power of machines will allow us to extract meaning from what was previously insignificant. 

We can never predict the future. No one was sketching the likeness of the internet 60 years ago -- cars and its iterative future the flying car dominating the future-scapes. I think of Kelly's writings more as fuel for current projects -- is there a tangent in these ideas that fascinates? Maybe these ideas are source material for ideas that diverge from the current status quo.
