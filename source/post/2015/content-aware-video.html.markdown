I love video recipes as a resource for non-traditional preparations that aren’t well documented. I sometimes prefer 
video to a written recipe because there’s absolute transparency in the process (honesty).

But video, compared to text, is really terrible for skimming — especially if it’s long format. Last night, I played 
around with a mock interface for content aware video. With it you can use the text to scrub the video and find exactly 
what you’re looking for.

I added a slight delay to the transcript’s hover events to create less sensitivity and a more predictable interaction — 
just passing over a word doesn’t seek the playhead but a 250ms pause over a word will. But after sitting with it, I 
think click events are a more natural interface for seeking the playhead over text.
