### Impressions

Days after buying [my bike](https://www.bennobikes.com/e-bikes/boost/#boost-performance) I regretted forgoing the Bosch speed motor option. My third generation motor is factory limited to 20MPH. I talked myself out of the $1,000 upgrade reasoning a slower bike was a safer bike and the 28MPH limit would invite reckless speeding. But the first week crisscrossing San Francisco for errands and joy-rides it was plain that the 20MPH limit was slowing me down. Even with SF's hills and traffic signals I found myself constantly running up against limit. Two or three strokes from a cold-start I would feel the lurch of the motor de-powering and the weight of the bike dragging me backwards. Moving to a mountain town with long stretches of empty roads further whetted my appetite to break free. 

Installing the Speedbox 3.0 chip was easy and has since "just worked". I love that the chip is activated at will and the riding characteristics of the Bosch have been unchanged though battery range has expectantly deteriorated. I definitely recommend. 

### Installation

    })

Unfasten the motor housing by removing 2 allen screws on the drive-side and 3 phillips screws on the non-drive side. The housing can be removed without pulling the crank.

Remove the display cable (2) and the speed sensor (3) and insert into the reciprocal Speedbox junction connectors. The battery (3) and light cables (4) can be left as is.

I nestled the Speedbox chip and cables into the seatpost tube and fixed their position with the battery cable.
