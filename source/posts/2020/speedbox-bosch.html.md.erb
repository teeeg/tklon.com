### Impressions

Days after buying [my bike](https://www.bennobikes.com/e-bikes/boost/#boost-performance) I regretted forgoing the Bosch speed motor option. My third generation motor is factory limited to 20MPH. I talked myself out of the $1,000 upgrade reasoning a slower bike was a safer bike and that the 28MPH limit would invite reckless speeding. But in the first week of crisscrossing San Francisco for errands and joy-rides it was plain that it was slowing me down. Even with SF's hills and traffic signals I found myself constantly running up against the limit. Two or three strokes from a cold-start I would feel the lurch of the motor de-activating and all of the bike's 65 pounds leaning into me.

Shortly thereafter I moved to a suburban mountain town. My mom actually moved me, my bike, and a few boxes since I don't own a car. So far, intra-city travel is overwhelmingly possible and even a joy. There are enough bike trails and back roads that I feel safe enough to glance between errand stops without the threat of traffic. Even elevation (which there is a lot of here) is manageable now at 13 or 15MPH, steadily chugging up the hill to the hum of the motor with watermelon and beer in tow. But the monotony of the long flats begins to grate. The motor essentially sits idle between my legs while I keep slugging away at 21MPH.
  
So I bought a tuning chip online [from the Czech Republic](https://www.speedbox-tuning.com/). The device intercepts and manipulates the speed sensor data so that measurements never exceed the maximum allowable speed. Installation was easy and has since "just worked". I love that the chip is activated at will and the riding characteristics of the Bosch have been unchanged though battery range has expectantly deteriorated. I definitely recommend. 

### Installation

Unfasten the motor housing by removing 2 allen screws on the drive-side and 3 phillips screws on the non-drive side. The housing can be removed without pulling the crank.

Remove the display cable (2) and the speed sensor (3) and insert into the reciprocal Speedbox junction connectors. The battery (3) and light cables (4) can be left as is.

I nestled the Speedbox chip and cables into the seatpost tube and fixed their position with the battery cable.
