#### _Albert Camus_, _The Stranger_

Camus refers to religion as a form of "philosophical suicide." This book was publish in 1942 and still today rings true and vibrant.

#### _Erik Larson_, _The Devil in the White City: A Saga of Magic and Murder at the Fair that Changed America_

Captivating portrait of late 19th century Chicago as the city was in the midst of its ascendancy to a major United States city-center. Larson goes to great lengths to capture the mood, smells, and energies of the city and nation. It's the best kind of historical narrative held together by an engaging backdrop of murder and mystery.
