##### 1/26 - The Underground Railroad 
A literal re-imagining of the underground railroad narrative bringing focus to the hypocrisy and inanity of the American slave “engine”. Atmospherically and tonally comparable to _The Road_’s post-apocalyptic world. This book prompted me to think a lot about truth, and what leads to a society governed by hypocrisies. Truths are fractal: their definition growing sharper with examination, in different contexts expanding. I loved being a reader of this book, the author always ahead of me, pacing hazard with great opportunities for reflection.

##### 1/18 - Story of Your Life and Others
Chiang’s stories are thought experiments. Reinterpretations of our reality that tend to challenge the rules that govern our physical/social/spiritual/etc existence. Chiang asks, for example, what if we could eliminate the influence of human beauty -- no longer differentiate between unpleasant and pleasing? I loved his "story notes" at the end. Definitely a great collection of stories to prompt your noodle into deep thought. 

##### 1/7 - Wind Up Bird Chronicles
Gosh, this book was always in my periphery since something like 2008 (it was originally published in '94). A layered 
story I should probably read through again. At least a second time through I might be able to discern what trajectory
the plot is on. The storyline was really vexing but the common tale of suffering relatable -- I regard it as a kind
of statement on the power of self-reflection.
